## Functionality

### check-disk-fail
Check the output of dmesg for a given set of strings that may correspond to a failure

### check-disk
Check disk capacity and inodes based upon the output of df.

### check-fs-writeable
Check to make sure a filesytem is writable.  This will check both proc and do a smoke test of each given mountpoint.  It can also auto-discover mount points in the self namespace.

### check-fstab-mounts
Check the mount points in */etc/fstab* to ensure they are all accounted for.

### disk-capacity-metrics
Acquire disk capacity metrics from `df` and convert them to a form usable by graphite

### disk-metrics
Read */proc/iostats* for disk metrics and put them in a form usable by Graphite.  See [iostats.txt](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/iostats.txt) for more details.

### disk-usage-metrics
Based on disk-capacity-metrics.rb by bhenerey and nstielau. The difference here being how the key is defined in graphite and the size we emit to graphite(now using megabytes), inode info has also been dropped.
